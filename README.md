# Customer-Segmentation-and-Lifetime-Value-using-K-means-DBSCAN-XGBOOST
This is the group project in my university which I am a leader. We use some machine learning model such as: K-means, DBSCAN, XGBoost, BG/NBD and Gamma Gamma to cluster customer and predict their lifetime value. Then we figure out the most effective and suitable.
